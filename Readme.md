# Simplex-algorithm-Linear-programming

This project is implementation of simplex algorithm (linear programming) in Matlab.

All scripts from main folder except from "SimplexAlgorithm_ExampleWithExplanation" and "SimplexAlgorithm_OptimizationWithSamples" are auxiliary functions. They were used both to optimize size of script in main scripts and shorten time of building the final effect.
First from mentioned scripts is explanation of how this algorithm works in practice (in Matlab), to see how this works run consecutive lines containing any comments.
To see the result, you can just run "EffectofBellmanFordProtocolForLargeNetworks.m" script with sample simplex arrays ad check the final results in console.

Project can be extended in the future to find a set of optimal solutions (including straight line or geometric figure).
